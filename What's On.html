            <p>At Burnley Community Arts Festival, we are committed to bringing you an unforgettable experience that you'll never forget. 
                We offer a variety of stalls for everyone!
                Families and friends are encouraged to visit workshops, see performances and experience the arts! <br>
                 We often fail to appreciate all the hard work that goes into
                each and every thing you can find at the festival so feel free to chat to artists and vendors to learn more and meet new people!</p>

                        <p>We asked our staff what makes a festival. Music was the near unanimous answer, and we know, just as you do,
                             that no festival is truly complete without music!
                            Often, we struggle to broaden our horizons and discover the gems hidden beneath mainstream music,
                             so we do our part to shine a light on your local artists
                            and bring them to your attention! You never know, the next big thing could be your next door neighbour!</p>

                             Thankfully we have a wonderful 
                            selection of stalls and vendors who are more than willing to share their culinary skills and experitse.
                             Truly, the hardest part of coming to BCAF is choosing where you're going for lunch!</p>
