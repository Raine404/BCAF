            <p>What is an arts festival without any art! Truly the essence of this festival, sharing art is what helps to bring us
             together as a community! While it can often feel that there's too much to keep track of, here at BCAF we're here to help 
            ensure that you dont miss out on your next favourite local artisan!</p>

             them! With a diverse range of artists each sharing their skills and talents, </p>
