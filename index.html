            <h2>What are we</h2> 
            <p>Burnley Community Arts Festival is a new initiative to bring the arts back to Burnley! Our annual festival will showcase local talent, vendors and more over two days, 
                providing small communities, businesses and artists the chance to share their wares and cultures. <br> We are a small, non-profit organisation, 
                with all the funds raised through the event going right back into the community. We pride ourselves on creating an open, welcoming and diverse space 
                where we can really celebrate what makes Burnley, Burnley! 
                <br>It's the people that make a place, and Burnley is no exception! BCAF is a chance to really get to know Burnley,
                whether you've lived here your whole life or haven't heard of us before today.

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>This festival - the first of many we hope - showcases a variety of talents, skills and crafts, all handpicked to bring you an incredible experience! <br> 
                Our organisation has a zero-tolerance policy, so you can rest assured that you can enjoy this event to the fullest without fear of harassment or judgment.
                Our priority, as always is on the safety and security of our visitors so don't be surprised to see our incredible security team at work around the site!</p>
            <p>We believe that art should be free for everyone to appreciate no matter what, thats why we will never charge admission! Instead, we offer visitors the option to
